# LibraryManagementSystem

To run the web app simply execute the mvnw file and create mysql database with libraryschema.sql and users.sql and in application.properties swap jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_schema with your hosted database address.

For this project, I used Java Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySQL as a database, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for User Interface

I used Dependeny injection and Inversion of control, also used very useful Java anotations and for DAO i implemented Jpa Repository for automatic methods for crud operations

For Sql database view libraryschema.sql and users.sql

I could not add Librarians management system and reports other than that eveything is ready
